# Vue Timezones

## Setup 

In order to get the app running, server and client dependencies must be installed. 

In order to get server side dependencies installed run `pipenv install` or `pip install flask arrow` in the case that pipenv install isn't functioning correctly.

To launch the server run `python server.py`. At this point if you make a GET request to http://localhost:9123 it should return an affirmative message.
